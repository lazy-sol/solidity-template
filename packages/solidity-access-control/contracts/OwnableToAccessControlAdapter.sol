/**
 * @title OZ Ownable to AccessControl Adapter (short: AccessControl Adapter)
 *
 * @notice Helper contract allowing to change the access model of the already deployed
 *      OpenZeppelin Ownable contract to the AccessControl model
 *
 * @dev Installation Flow
 *      Prerequisite: deployed OZ Ownable contract (target contract) address (target_address)
 *
 *      1. Deploy the AccessControl Adapter bound to the already deployed OZ Ownable contract
 *         (specify the target OZ Ownable contract address in the constructor upon the deployment)
 *
 *            const adapter = await (artifacts.require("OwnableToAccessControlAdapter")).new(target_address);
 *
 *      2. Define what Ownable-restricted public functions on the target contract you'd like to be able
 *         to provide access to through the adapter contract
 *
 *      3. Map every such function with the role required to execute it using `updateAccessRole()` function
 *         For example, to be able to provide an access to the transferOwnership(address) function, you could do
 *
 *            const ROLE_TRANSFER_OWNERSHIP_MANAGER = 0x00010000;
 *            await adapter.updateAccessRole("transferOwnership(address)", ROLE_TRANSFER_OWNERSHIP_MANAGER);
 *
 *      4. Provide the roles to the corresponding operators as you would usually do with AccessControl
 *         For example, if you wish an address 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000Ff1CE to grant an access to the
 *         transferOwnership(address) function on the target, you could do
 *
 *            const operator = "0x00000000000000000000000000000000000Ff1CE";
 *            await adapter.updateRole(operator, ROLE_TRANSFER_OWNERSHIP_MANAGER);
 *
 *      5. Transfer the ownership of the target contract to the deployed AccessControl Adapter contract
 *         Note that you can also do steps 2-4 after the step 5
 *
 * @dev Usage Flow
 *      Prerequisite: installed AccessControl Adapter with the access to at least one restricted target contract
 *      function configured
 *
 *      To execute the restricted access function on the target contract via the AccessControl Adapter
 *      1. Use target contract ABI to construct a low-level function call calldata
 *         For example, to construct the transferOwnership() function calldata to transfer the ownership to the
 *         0x00000000000000000000000000000000DEAdc0De address, you could do
 *
 *            const to = "0x00000000000000000000000000000000DEAdc0De";
 *            const calldata = target.contract.methods.transferOwnership(to).encodeABI();
 *
 *       2. Execute a low-level function call on the AccessControl Adapter contract using the constructed calldata
 *          For example, to execute the transferOwnership() function (prepared in step 1), you could do
 *
 *            await web3.eth.sendTransaction({
 *                from: operator,
 *                to: adapter.address,
 *                data: calldata,
 *            }
 *
 *        3. It is also ok to add an ether to the transaction by adding a value field to the `sendTransaction` call,
 *           as well as sending plain ether transfer transaction, as long as target contract has payable functions,
 *           and/or has a default payable receiver
