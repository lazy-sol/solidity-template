It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once.

ERC1967Proxy\n *\n * @notice Access control smart contract provides an API to check\n *      if a specific operation is permitted globally and/or\n *      if a particular user has a permission to execute it.\n *\n * @notice It deals with two main entities: features and roles.\n *\n * @notice Features are designed to be used to enable/disable public functions\n *      of the smart contract (used by a wide audience).\n * @notice User roles are designed to control the access to restricted functions\n *      of the smart contract (used by a limited set of maintainers).\n *\n * @notice Terms \"role\", \"permissions\" and \"set of permissions\" have equal meaning\n *      in the documentation text and may be used interchangeably.\n * @notice Terms \"permission\", \"single permission\" implies only one permission bit set.\n *\n * @notice Access manager is a special role which allows to grant/revoke other roles.\n *      Access managers can only grant/revoke permissions which they have themselves.\n *      As an example, access manager with no other roles set can only grant/revoke its own\n *      access manager permission and nothing else.\n *\n * @notice Access manager permission should be treated carefully, as a super admin permission:\n *      Access manager with even no other permission can interfere with another account by\n *      granting own access manager permission to it and effectively creating more powerful\n *      permission set than its own.\n *\n * @dev Both current and OpenZeppelin AccessControl implementations feature a similar API\n *      to check/know \"who is allowed to do this thing\".\n * @dev Zeppelin implementation is more flexible:\n *      - it allows setting unlimited number of roles, while current is limited to 256 different roles\n *      - it allows setting an admin for each role, while current allows having only one global admin\n * @dev Current implementation is more lightweight:\n *      - it uses only 1 bit per role, while Zeppelin uses 256 bits\n *      - it allows setting up to 256 roles at once, in a single transaction, while Zeppelin allows\n *        setting only one role in a single transaction\n *\n * @dev This smart contract is designed to be inherited by other\n *      smart contracts which require access control management capabilities.\n *\n * @dev Access manager permission has a bit 255 set.\n *      This bit must not be used by inheriting contracts for any other permissions/features.\n *\n * @dev This is an upgradeable version of the ACL, based on Zeppelin implementation for ERC1967,\n *      see https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable\n *      see https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#UUPSUpgradeable\n *      see
